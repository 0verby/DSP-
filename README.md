## **APPLIED DATA SCIENCE**

This page is devoted to my final applied data science project class at Bellevue University. Featured on this page will include copies of my projects and resume. 

## **ABOUT ME**
I decided halfway through my career life to change the course and explore data more. The decision was based on a love for cleaning up databases and exploring and creating reports for others to understand the information more efficiently. This lead to attending Bellevue University for a bachelor's in Data Science. While proficient in word and excel from working for almost 20 years as an administrative assistant, I had very very little experience in any kind of computer language or coding experience. I am now in my last term at Bellevue and will earn my bachelor's degree shortly.

## **PROJECTS DURING COURSE**
<ul>
<li><strong> ENERGY CONSUMPTION PREDICTIVE MODEL</strong></li><a href="https://0verby.github.io/DSP/Energy">Energy</a>
<ul>
<br><b> Source </b> <br>  
  <ul> - Available from Kaggle.com</ul>
  <ul> - Energy-Consumption-Prediction</ul> 
    
<br><b> Purpose </b> <br>
  <ul> - What are the main factors influencing energy consumption? </ul> 
  <ul> - Can we predict future enegy consumption in buildins using historical data?</ul> 
    
<br><b> Outcome </b><br>
  <ul> - I was tasked with the data wrangling in this project.</ul>
  <ul> - Utilize our model as a predictive engine</ul>
    
<br><b> Reflection </b> <br>
  <ul>  - More analysis is needed to determine additional relevent features.</ul>
  <ul>  - Experiment more with different model types and hyperparameters.</ul>  

</ul>
<br><br>
<li> <b>DATA SALARY PREDICTIVE MODEL</b></li><a href="https://0verby.github.io/DSP/Salary">Salary</a>
<ul>
<br><b> Source </b> 
  <ul> - Available from ai-jobs.net</ul>
  <ul> - The Global AI, ML, Data Science Salary Index for 2024</ul>

  <br>
  <br><b> Purpose </b> <br>
  <ul> - What are the key factors influencing salary levels in data-related roles? </ul> 
  <ul> - Can we develop a predictive model that accurately forecasts salaries for data-related roles based on historical data?</ul> 
    
<br><b> Outcome </b><br>
  <ul> - I was tasked with the data visualization in this project.</ul>
  <ul> - Not enough historical data on new fields and career topics.</ul>
    
<br><b> Reflection </b> <br>
  <ul>  - More data is needed to determine additional relevent features.</ul>
  <ul>  - Experiment more with different model types and hyperparameters.</ul>
